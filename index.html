   <h1>The commencement of the first website.</h1>
      <p> Hello, My name is Arturo Arreola, and this is my first attempt at making a website like this. Please click on to learn a bit more about myself. Thank you!</p>
      <p>As you click between the few different options, you'll get a sneak peak into what I do for a living, as well as where I come from (Home town, school, etc.), as well as to what I do in my free time.</p>
